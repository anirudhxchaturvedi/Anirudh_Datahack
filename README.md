<h1>Project Title:</h1>
Predicting Flu Vaccine Uptake Using Machine Learning
<h1>Project Description:</h1>
This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of individuals receiving two types of flu vaccines: the XYZ flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. The analysis utilizes a dataset with various features related to demographic information, health behaviors, medical recommendations, and personal opinions on vaccine effectiveness and risks.This project will provide insights into factors influencing flu vaccine uptake and demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in public health analytics.
<h1>Deliverables:</h1>
<h3>Predictive Model</h3>
A trained machine learning model capable of predicting the probabilities of receiving each vaccine.
<h3>Evaluation Report</h3>
A detailed report on model performance, including ROC AUC scores for both target variables.
<h3>Submission File:</h3>
A CSV file containing the respondent IDs and the predicted probabilities for each vaccine.
